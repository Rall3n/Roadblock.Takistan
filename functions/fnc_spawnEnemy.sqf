/*Planned:
Random timer between attacks
Enemies stay on the hill, snipers eventually
Suicide Bombers on foot (explosion on kill), in cars (explosion in base, near base)
Information from the base that an attack will occur in some minutes (combined with the random timer)
Really big attacks with armored vehicles (support from base - for us) - only with information before
*/
